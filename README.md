## Objective

This web application allows users to create AI-based bots, deploy them on different messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.), and interact with them in a human-like manner.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Users should be able to log in to the application via an authentication form.
- The application must support standard authentication (email/password).

### 2. Bot Creation

- Users can create a bot by providing a custom AI prompt.
- Each bot can be configured with platform-specific instructions (e.g., adapting the language according to the platform).

### 3. Supported Messaging Platforms

- Bots can be deployed on multiple messaging platforms, including:
  - WhatsApp
  - Telegram
  - Other platforms (to be defined)

### 4. Bot Deployment

- Users can choose which messaging platform to deploy their bot on.
- The bot can be launched on multiple platforms simultaneously, but it must adhere to human-like timing constraints to avoid automated behaviors.

### 5. Profile Configuration

- Users can configure their profiles on messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.).
  - For example: WhatsApp authentication, linking their account to the bot API, etc.
- The application must store configuration data securely.

### 6. Bot Interaction with Messages

- When a message is received by the bot, it reads the message and generates a response via AI.
- The bot must simulate human behavior:
  - Limit actions to one at a time (no rapid sending of multiple messages).
  - Responses must be realistic and contextually appropriate for the received message.

## Technical Constraints

- **Performance and Human Behavior**:
  - The bot must behave realistically on messaging platforms (no spamming, no overly fast responses).
  - A reasonable delay should be introduced between each response to simulate a natural interaction.

```

## Security

- User credentials must be stored securely (hashed passwords).
- Connections to messaging platforms must be secured via APIs and tokens.

## Testing

- Tests must be conducted to validate the correct behavior of bots on each platform.
- Test the bot's ability to handle incoming messages and respond realistically.
